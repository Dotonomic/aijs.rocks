Perfect your moves and get better at TikTok dancing with this fun demo by Jen Looper.

It uses [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), which allows you to pinpoint body motion and draw a 'skeleton' on a video. This is combined with a webcam mapping of your own dance skeleton, a bit of Maths to compare the matching points, Azure functions to authenticate a user, and PlayFab as a game-friendly backend to keep scores and create a leaderboard.
