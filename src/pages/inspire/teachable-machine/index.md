Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone.

It's for educators, artists, students, innovators, makers of all kinds â€“ really, anyone who has an idea they want to explore. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.
