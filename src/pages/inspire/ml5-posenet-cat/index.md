This ml5.js PoseNet cat app was created by Denisa Marcisovska, and turns the viewersâ€™ face into a cat. It uses [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) to find the facial points, and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to draw cat eyes, whiskers, nose and ears at the relevant location on the users' face. There is some additional Maths so the cat parts will resize depending on how far away the user is from the camera. 

As an added extra, there are some buttons which make meowing, hissing, or purring noise in the background if they choose!

Try it out now [here](https://dmarcisovska.github.io/ml5-posenet-cat/)
