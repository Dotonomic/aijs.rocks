In this interactive demo, I have used Google Magenta's [DrumsRNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/drums_rnn) to generate continuous drum patterns based on your input pattern inside a seed limit. Based on your seed limit, the Deep Recurrent Neural Network will generate continuous rhythm pattern that sounds awesome after you click on regenerate (red) button!
