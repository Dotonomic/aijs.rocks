Itâ€™s Time to Dance is a jolly Xmas experiment brought to you by two [Jam3](https://twitter.com/jam3) creatives;
[Amelie Rosser](https://twitter.com/ixviii_io) and [Victoire Douy](https://twitter.com/victoiredouy).


The desktop game tracks your movement and asks you to sing and dance by interacting with stickers.
It was created using React, WebGL, tensorflowjs and posenet. Try it out [here](https://itstimetodance-xmas.com/)
