Object detection opens up the capability of counting how many objects are in a scene, tracking motion and simply just locating an objectâ€™s position.

This demo uses the pretrained TensorFlow.js model [COCO-SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/coco-ssd) which is an Object detection model that aims to localize and identify multiple objects in a single image.
